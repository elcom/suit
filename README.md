# Suit

A collection of small, adaptive, structural CSS modules for building web UIs
and custom toolkits.


## Installation

Recommended: install [Bower](http://bower.io/), then run this command in your
project directory:

```
bower install --save suit
```

Alternative: (a download bundle will be available at some point)


## Official packages

Each package is stand-alone, contains its own documentation and tests, and is
written to follow a common set of [naming conventions and authoring
practices](doc). Dependencies are best managed using [Bower](http://bower.io/)
â€“ a package manager for the web.

## Features

**[Read about the design decisions and authoring principles of Suit](doc)**.

* Highly modular; each module is individually versioned.

* Provides common, low-level utility classes.

* Provides common structural UI patterns.

* Responsive grid.

* Consistent class name conventions.

* Work more with HTML than CSS.

* Theme-independence.

* Designed for large web sites and applications.

* Easy to build your application's custom toolkit on top of Suit.

* Very small footprint.


## Why?

* Monolithic UI frameworks don't make it easy to use, share, and version
  specific UI traits and components.
* Complex applications need to loosely couple content, document semantics, and
  presentational structure to make it easier to change any layer while minimizing the
  impact on other layers.
* Complex applications need to clearly surface and scope the relationship
  between all HTML classes (and their attached styles and behaviour).
* Complex applications can accumulate technical debt when components are not
  kept independent of one-another, or the dependencies aren't clear.


## How?

* Build progressive enhancement into the UI layers themselves. Use low-level
  utilities to build up a skeleton UI.
* Codify the separation of responsibilities by using structured class names
  that reflect different purposes and relationships.
* Provide clear, constrained, and explicit authoring principles.
* Use multiple classes in HTML templates to combine styles.
* Organize discrete UI features into small, standalone packages / files.
